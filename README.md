## Guidelines
Simple photos gallery application

Your task is to build simple photos gallery based on Flickr's public API.

Features

Main features:

* get first 100 photos of dogs
* with captions - author, date, description
* add infinite scroll
* implement visible error handling from both engineering and user perspectives. 
* use loading indicators


After tackling the above, try to complete as many of the following as you can for extra points.

Extra features (for extra points):

* add ability to see author’s other pictures
* show map of dogs photos using geolocation
* allow to search for photos of dogs
* add offline functionality and ability to add app to Homescreen
* filter based on parameters: date, color (?), licence, and more

Feel free to add any extra features! Use any front-end stack you prefer.

We value production-readiness over completeness. If you won't be able to finish a part of the assignment, make a note of it in the README with a brief info on how you would've solved it.
